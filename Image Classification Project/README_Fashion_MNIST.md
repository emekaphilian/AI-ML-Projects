# üß† Fashion MNIST Image Classification with TensorFlow & Keras

Welcome to my deep learning project on **Fashion MNIST image classification**! This project demonstrates how to build, train, evaluate, and interact with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using **TensorFlow/Keras** on a widely-used dataset of fashion items. The final model allows users to **input an image index** and receive real-time predictions on what the image represents.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Dataset**: [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) ‚Äî 70,000 grayscale 28x28 images in 10 categories
- **Goal**: Classify clothing items such as T-shirts, trousers, shoes, and bags using CNNs
- **Tools & Frameworks**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset Details

The Fashion MNIST dataset includes:
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
- 10 total fashion categories:

| Label | Class        |
|-------|--------------|
| 0     | T-shirt/top  |
| 1     | Trouser      |
| 2     | Pullover     |
| 3     | Dress        |
| 4     | Coat         |
| 5     | Sandal       |
| 6     | Shirt        |
| 7     | Sneaker      |
| 8     | Bag          |
| 9     | Ankle boot   |

## üß† Model Architecture

- Input Layer: 28x28 grayscale images
- 2 Convolutional Layers + MaxPooling
- Flatten + Dense Layers
- Output Layer with 10 softmax neurons

The model is trained using **Sparse Categorical Crossentropy** and **Adam optimizer** with high accuracy on validation data.

## ‚ú® Interactive Prediction

At the end of the script, you‚Äôll find an **interactive section** where you can:
- Input an index (0‚Äì9999)
- View the corresponding image
- Get a prediction of the fashion category

```bash
Enter an image index (0-9999) to predict: 42
```

It returns the predicted label and confidence score ‚Äî e.g., ‚ÄúSneaker (Confidence: 97.35%)‚Äù.
