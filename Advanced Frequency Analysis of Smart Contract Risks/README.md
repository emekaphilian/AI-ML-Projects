# 🛡️ Correlation Analysis of Smart Contract Risks

This project focuses on performing a detailed frequency and correlation analysis on smart contract risk tags using Python in Google Colab.

## 🚀 Objective
To uncover patterns, trends, and correlations between vulnerabilities in smart contracts—informing better decision-making and security measures.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Google Colab**

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Exploitation** was the most frequent risk tag.
- High frequency of `centralized_risk_medium` suggests growing centralization.
- Strong correlation between:
  - `buy_tax` ↔ `sell_tax`
  - `slippage_modifiable` ↔ `anti-whale_modifiable`
  - `hidden_owner` ↔ `airdrop_scam`

## 📌 Skills Applied
- ✅ Data Entry & Annotation
- ✅ Data Cleaning & Transformation
- ✅ Statistical Correlation Analysis
- ✅ Dynamic Data Visualization
- ✅ Blockchain Risk Analysis
- ✅ Python Scripting

## 🧠 Conclusion
Understanding these correlations is essential for identifying vulnerabilities and improving the safety of smart contract ecosystems.
