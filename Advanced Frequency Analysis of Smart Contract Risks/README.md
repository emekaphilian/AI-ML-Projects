**Frequency & Correlation Analysis**

!Advanced Frequency Analysis of Smart Contract Risks/images/cover_image.png  
* 🔍 A deep dive into smart contract risk patterns to improve blockchain security and audit readiness.*

---

## 🧠 Project Summary

This project explores the **frequency** and **correlation** of risk tags found in smart contracts, offering a data-driven perspective to aid developers, auditors, and DeFi participants in identifying systemic vulnerabilities and co-occurring threats.

---

## 🔍 Objective

- Detect the **most frequent vulnerabilities** in smart contracts.
- Analyze the **correlation between risk types** using the **Phi coefficient**.
- Reveal hidden risk patterns that may not be apparent in isolated testing.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- Cleaned and structured a dataset of binary-labeled smart contract risks.
- Visualized frequency distribution and correlation patterns.
- Applied **Phi correlation** to uncover co-occurring vulnerabilities.
- Interpreted results to provide **actionable security insights**.

## 📈 Key Insights

- 🔁 **Reentrancy w/o ETH Transfer** is strongly correlated with **Packed Collision** (Φ ≈ 0.51)
- 🕵️ **Closed Source** contracts often include **Hidden Owner** risks (Φ ≈ 0.32)
- 🚫 Contracts using **Blacklist functions** show low correlation with **Centralization risks**, challenging common assumptions.
- 📊 Over 65% of risk occurrences are concentrated in just **three vulnerabilities**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Phi Correlation Coefficient** (SciPy/Numpy)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Wrangling & Visualization**

## 🔐 Why It Matters

This analysis equips the Web3 community with better tools to **understand vulnerabilities**, design **safer contracts**, and improve **automated audits**. With new exploits surfacing daily, correlational analysis reveals risk relationships that traditional checks might miss.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project shows how **statistical methods** can improve smart contract security assessments. With insights from the Phi correlation matrix, we can:

- Identify hidden or suspicious behaviors in DeFi contracts.
- Improve audits and transparency.
- Strengthen design choices with proactive, data-backed decisions.



---

## 💡 Next Steps

- Integrate machine learning for risk prediction
- Expand dataset to include attack history
- Automate detection of high-risk tag combinations
