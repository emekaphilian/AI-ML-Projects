[![Colab Ready](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-Notebook-orange)](#run-in-google-colab)

A collaborative filtering recommender system that leverages matrix factorization (SVD) to suggest Amazon electronic products based on users' previous reviews and ratings.

> 📊 Trained on the [Amazon Electronics Reviews Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamparab/amazon-electronics-reviews) — 1.6M+ real-world user reviews!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Collaborative filtering using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**
- 📦 Real Amazon user data (1.6M+ records)
- 💻 **Streamlit web app** for user-friendly interaction
- ☁️ **Google Colab** + `ngrok` deployment
- ❄️ Cold-start strategy discussion
- 🧼 Modular, well-documented code

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter a valid **User ID**
2. The model identifies products the user hasn’t reviewed
3. Predicts likely ratings using SVD
4. Displays the **Top 5 personalized recommendations**

---

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| **RMSE** | ~1.10 |
| **MAE**  | ~0.82 |

These scores reflect the model’s predictive accuracy on test data.
